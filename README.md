# First-Project
This is my first project.
This is a MERN stack web app.

The reason i created this app was to build experience working with the MERN technologies. 
This is the first project I wrote that that did not explictly follow a tutorial.

Some of the features that I included in this app was a working contact form that sends emails to my personal Gmail account.
Another feature is the full CRUD blog that I wrote, which includes authentication.
I wrote created this app for a sinlge person. i knew that i wanted certain functionality to be locked behind an authentication wall. Therefore, I made it where anyone who
is authenticated has the ability to create, update and delete blog posts, while at the same time any blog post that is created is available to be read by anyone who clicks
on the post.
